The [OpenSPIM](http://openspim.org/) project is a collaboration between multiple
labs to establish an accessible, easily adjustable light sheet microscope
system.

The *SPIMAcquisition* plugin for [Micro Manager](https://micro-manager.org) is
the primary means to acquire image stacks with the OpenSPIM setups.

This version of the OpenSPIM acquisition plugin features [ClearVolume](https://clearvolume.bitbucket.org/)-powered live rendering of acquired Z-stacks.
